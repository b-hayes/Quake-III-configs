// 500fps gives advantage of physics rounding like 125 but more so as long as server is allowing it.
// you can actually set fps to 334 and it will just jump straight to 500.
com_maxfps 500
snaps 125
sv_fps 125
// any server you join should also have sv_fps set to 125 or this framerate will feel choppy af and not give any advantage.
